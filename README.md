# PFAS-Hazard-Index-Calculator
A simple app to calculate the Hazard Index for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's latest proposed Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFNA, PFHxS, PFBS, and HFPO-DA.

## More info
The U.S. EPA proposed Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for key PFAS compounds on March 14.

However, the MCLs for four of those compounds aren't as simple as a single parts-per-trillion (ppt) measurement. Instead, EPA has proposed a "Hazard Index" approach, which measures the sum of four PFAS concentrations weighted against their respective Health-Based Water Concentrations.

The hazard index specifically concerns the following four compounds: perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, also known as GenX Chemicals).

I've made a handy application that can calculate a water sample's potential hazard index score. To use it, simply type the number of each detected compounds concentration (in ppt), and the hazard index result will be generated automatically.
